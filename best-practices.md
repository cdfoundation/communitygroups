# Best Practices
This page guides the running of a new Continuous Delivery Foundation Community Group based on the experience of existing ones.

Here is a list of suggestions and tips to get you started:

## Create the Continuous Delivery Foundation Community Group
CDF staff is responsible for creating the Continuous Delivery Foundation Community Groups (see the instructions in the [README.md](https://github.com/cdfoundation/communitygroups/blob/main/README.md) file, but please see the official [Bevy documentation on how to create a chapter](https://help.bevylabs.com/article/454-create-a-chapter).

The description of the group is left to the discretion of the organizers.

A brief description of the role of the CDF and the Continuous Delivery approach could be added.

You can use text from our statement of [Principles](https://github.com/cdfoundation/toc/blob/master/PRINCIPLES.md).

The most important thing is to keep an active group, with frequent events (ideally once a month). We encourage folks to run either online events or regular meetup events.

Sustaining a group yourself can be challenging to manage. Ideally, it would be best if you had a team of passionate and committed co-organizers.

Joining forces helps spread the load and expands the network.

## Find Speakers
You should provide some form to allow people to submit their talk proposal [similar to this one](https://forms.gle/VZEXDbNiZRmYucfi9).

When possible, take care to review their presentations.

Attend conferences (e.g. cdCon, KubeCon, Spinnaker Summit, etc.) where you can find speakers and meet many people who use or are involved in the CDF projects that may be interested in joining your group.

## Find sponsors/venues
You should contact local technology companies. Many of them are interested in hosting such kinds of events.

It is better to find a place in a central location. Downtown would be ideal because it's easier to access for most of the attendees.

## Schedule a new event
First of all, don't forget to thank your sponsors.

Then the essential information is about the agenda. Each talk description should contain:
* A short bio of the speaker
* An attractive title
* A paragraph describing the content of the presentation/demo

If you're planning a hands-on demo, you should ensure that the WiFi can handle the number of attendees.

Furthermore, you should check you're not limited by some quotas (Cloud provider).

The choice of date and time matters. Most meetups choose Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays after work.

## Booking
If the room capacity limits you, you should do an overbooking.

Most of the time, there are 30% of people who register but donâ€™t attend.

You should think about sending a reminder message to the meetup group to ask the people to free their place if they can't come.

## Post event
If possible, you should record videos of the presentations and take pictures for social media and the event page to share afterward.

You should also share the slides with all members after the event. Optionally, please submit them to the [CDF Presentations repo](https://github.com/cdfoundation/presentations) on GitHub.

## CDF SWAG
If you're a newly created Chapter that hosted two successful events, please reach out to [bevy@cd.foundation](mailto:mailto:bevy@cd.foundation) for a complimentary $50 SWAG certificate to the [CDF Store](https://store.cd.foundation).

## Ask for help
If you have any other questions, you can ask them in the [CDF Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/cdeliveryfdn/shared_invite/zt-nwc0jjd0-G65oEpv5ynFfPD5oOX5Ogg) #communitygroups.
