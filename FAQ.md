# FAQ - About Bevy
## What is Bevy?
Bevy is a scalable community events platform, powering the communities of Figma, Slack, GoDaddy, Twitch, Miro, Asana, Salesforce and many others. It already powers our [Continuous Delivery Foundation Community Groups](https://community.cd.foundation/).
  
## What are the benefits of using Bevy?
Bevy is centralizing all CDF groups, across the globe –– making it easier for community members to find and access local events like meetups, conferences, workshops, etc., into one CDF events hub; offer a better experience for group organizers when announcing events and communicating with group members; provide better insights into the global CDF community analytics and data to allow us to provide the best possible support to our communities and yourselves as organizers.

## FAQ - Switching from Meetup to Bevy

### Why is CDF switching over from Meetup to Bevy?
We are switching to Bevy because we’ve heard your concerns. Meetup was not the best tool to build community, especially an online community. It was not easy to communicate with community members on Meetup, run online events, and it was hard to keep group members active and engaged or to gauge who was active or engaged. The ability to collect data was limited and ultimately, it felt like a very disjointed experience for CDF itself.

### When do I need to switch over from Meetup to Bevy?
CDF will stop supporting groups on Meetup on Friday, December 31st, 2022. We can provide you instructions on how to create an account on Bevy if you haven’t already done so.

### What will happen to my group on Meetup after the switch to Bevy?
CDF currently pays for Pro membership for over 80 groups on Meetup. CDF will stop paying for this membership and end our contract with Meetup. Some of you may have spent years building your groups on Meetup but since we know only about 20-30% of group members are active in any group, it would be a confusing and unfair experience for community members to have to seek out information about your group on Meetup and Bevy. To make things easier for everyone involved, we’ve decided to close down the groups we’d been paying for. Additionally, when we stop paying for the groups there would be a short window in which someone else could step up and take financial responsibility for keeping the group open, but that is not a cost we felt any of our leaders or community members should shoulder. We have invested a lot of analysis, time, and money into moving our events community onto Bevy and we are confident it will be a much better experience for leaders on group management and members on event attendance.

### Will all my group members switch over from Meetup to Bevy?
No. Only ~20% of your group members are probably active and so we’d imagine only the most active group members from Meetup will actually make an account and join your Bevy group. This means you will have the most accurate number of group members in your groups on Bevy and can build a truly cohesive and engaged group.

### How are we communicating this change to group members?
In November 2022, we will send an email and Meetup message to the group members letting them know about this upcoming change.

### When will my group page be ready?
If you are an owner of the Meetup group that already exists on the CDF Community Groups platform or you want to bootstrap a new group on Bevy, please follow the instructions on the [ReadMe page](https://github.com/cdfoundation/communitygroups) to apply. Meetup has a function that allows for group and member data from Meetup to be transferred from Meetup to Bevy. This means that as long as you and your group members sign up for a new Bevy account using the same email address you used for your Meetup account, all of your group and even history will show up automatically in your new Bevy account.

### Will I have to start from scratch when building my group on Bevy?
No. We are migrating group and member data from Meetup to Bevy. All groups will have a page on Bevy and all of the data of your members will transfer over. When they make an account on Bevy to join your group, as long as they use the same email address they used on Meetup, all their information should populate over creating a seamless and hopefully improved community experience for your members.

### I am an organizer of the Meetup group, and my group was migrated on Bevy. However I don't have the organizers permissions. Why?
We will migrate the Meetup Groups, but organizers will not be migrated (it’s not technically possible, unfortunately). We'll encourage you to apply for running this chapter by emailing us [bevy@cd.foundation](mailto:bevy@cd.foundation]. Once the application is processed, we'll invite you as an organizer.

### Why can’t you simply create an account for everyone from Meetup to Bevy?
Because Bevy is a separate platform from Meetup, we are not legally able to set up a new account for all your current Meetup members, especially keeping GDPR regulations and privacy laws in mind. Keeping our users' privacy and consent intact is very important to us. Thank you for understanding.

## FAQ - General
### Will the pricing policy change?
CDF will cover all costs for the hosted community platform.

### How does the social coverage/network of Bevy compare to Meetup.com?
The events on a new platform will benefit from the CDF Marketing team's power and coverage. Compared to the Meetup.com-hosted events, the new platform allows hosting the events under the cd.foundation domain and embedding more deeply into the marketing tools and technologies currently used by CDF for the networking outreach. Furthermore, CDF is committed to marketing meetups and events across our platforms.

### How often are the Continuous Development Foundation Community Groups applications reviewed?
We review the CDF applications weekly, and if your submission satisfies our requirements and best practices, we'll send you an invitation.

### Do I need to re-apply?
No, once you formally apply, you are a part of the pool of applicants.

### Does CDF offer promotional support for the Community Groups?
CDF is happy to offer marketing support for the Community Groups in some exceptional cases.
Also, please make sure that you are aware of other community-focused CDF programs, including [CDF Ambassadors](https://cd.foundation/ambassadors/).

### I'd like to get in touch with the CDF ambassador in a specific city/region. Where can I find who a local ambassador is?
Here is a [map of the CDF Ambassadors](https://cd.foundation/blog/2022/03/07/welcome-2022-cdf-ambassadors/). You can then reach out to them personally on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/cdeliveryfdn/shared_invite/zt-nwc0jjd0-G65oEpv5ynFfPD5oOX5Ogg) 

## I have a question that was not answered in the FAQ -- how can I get in touch?
Please post questions in the #communitygroups channel in [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/cdeliveryfdn/shared_invite/zt-nwc0jjd0-G65oEpv5ynFfPD5oOX5Ogg) #communitygroups or email [bevy@cd.foundation](mailto:bevy@cd.foundation).
