# Continuous Delivery Community Groups
## Program description
The Continuous Delivery Foundation supports the worldwide community of the Continuous Delivery Community Groups (CDCG): https://community.cd.foundation/ 

CDF is currently working on expanding the Continuous Delivery community worldwide, and we are happy to accept new local communities to join our network.

If you are interested in joining the list of official CDF Community Groups, please review the information below.

The Continuous Delivery Community Groups program is powered by the [Bevy platform](https://www.bevy.com/), and managed by the CDF staff.

## Benefits of joining the CDF Community Groups Program
For all Continuous Delivery Community Groups, CDF offers the following benefits:
* One-time complimentary SWAG certificate ($50 USD) to the [CDF Store](https://store.cd.foundation/) (available after hosting at least two successful events per chapter).
* Boosting the visibility of your community group and events
* Cost coverage for the hosted community platform
* Video platform to host smaller events

## Best Practices
Please check out our [best practices](https://github.com/cdfoundation/communitygroups/blob/main/best-practices.md).

## How to apply?
The Continuous Delivery Community Group has to be created following the best practices described above.
* Visit https://community.cd.foundation/, and click "Log In" in the top right; you will be redirected to the Linux Foundation sign-in. Use your credentials or create a new account.
* [Fill out this form](https://forms.gle/Q9Ct9pWfxMWAPiZ79)
* Please note that this form is used for inviting the new Community Groups organizers only. If an active Community Group already exists in your region, please reach out to the organizers directly (do not use the form aboveâ€”the submitted application will be declined).
Once completed, CDF staff will provide you with access to your group.

## CDF Projects
CDF is also happy to provide the space for projects communities at https://community.cd.foundation/ (eg. to host the regular community meetings).
To request a community chapter for a CDF project, please email [bevy@cd.foundation](mailto:bevy@cd.foundation).

## How to enable the sync with Meetup.com?
The integration syncs events from Bevy to Meetup. It connects your Bevy group with your existing Meetup group and helps track member attendance and analytics. This integration requires adding the CDF Meetup Pro account as a co-organizer on your Meetup group.
* The "CDF Meetup Account" has to be added to your Meetup Group (CDF staff is managing this account), so please apply via [this form](https://forms.gle/Q9Ct9pWfxMWAPiZ79) and include the Meetup Group URL. If you run multiple groups, please apply every time with the new group URL.
* Once the CDF account joins your group, you'll need to follow the ["Appoint New Leadership Member" steps here:](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002879411-Managing-a-leadership-team) to add the [Continuous Delivery Foundation Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/members/273946049/) as co-organizer. Please see the [sample video](https://share.getcloudapp.com/8LujxJ85) on how to do this.
Please note:
* The events sync between Bevy and Meetup is only available to the groups that have already joined the CDF Meetup Pro network before February 1, 2022!
* To have the events sync with Meetup.com working correctly, please make sure that the ["CDF Meetup Account"](https://www.meetup.com/members/273946049/) is added to your group as a co-organizer! If this is not done, Bevy won't be able to create events on Meetup!
The steps described above do not migrate the existing users from a Meetup group to the new Community Group. More details about this could be found [in the FAQ](https://github.com/cdfoundation/communitygroups/blob/main/FAQ.md).

## Bevy Training
The CNCF and Bevy organized the training session for the Community Groups organizers. It has been recorded and now available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rBdomoYlmc). The CDF will have it's own training session in May 2022.

## Bevy Help Portal
Bevy Help Portal is available at https://help.bevylabs.com/.

## Communication
Please reach out to us on the **#communitygroups** channel on the [CDF slack](https://join.slack.com/t/cdeliveryfdn/shared_invite/zt-nwc0jjd0-G65oEpv5ynFfPD5oOX5Ogg). Please don't use DMs unless strictly necessary as doing so both has the potential of overwhelming project maintainers and others with similar questions lose the benefit of public discussion.
It's best if you use a public communication channel whenever possible; however, if you need to communicate in private, please feel free to send the program admins a note via [bevy@cd.foundation](mailto:bevy@cd.foundation) (please use the public channels for any program-related discussion).

## Support
If you have any technical difficulties with the platform itself, please reach out to the Bevy platform support directly.
